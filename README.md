# **Interactive Orrery Web App**

## **Overview**
This project is our submission for the **2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge**. Our aim is to create an interactive orrery web app that visualizes celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) in our solar system. The orrery offers both a static view and a dynamic, animated model that showcases the orbital paths and positions of these celestial bodies over time.

The web app is designed to educate users about celestial objects, with features that allow real-time exploration of planetary and asteroid data, supported by NASAâ€™s publicly available datasets.

### **Event**: 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge

## **Features**

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: View the solar system in an interactive manner with the ability to zoom, pan, and rotate.
- **Real-time Celestial Body Data**: Visualize the position of planets, NECs, NEAs, and PHAs using NASA's Keplerian parameters.
- **Orbital Trajectories**: Explore the colored orbital trajectories of celestial bodies, with options to enable/disable specific orbits.
- **Speed & Timeline Control**: Control the speed of the simulation and jump to a specific date to observe the solar system at any given time.
- **Labels and Views**: Toggle labels for celestial objects and switch between exterior and interior spaceship views.
- **AI-Powered Orbit Calculation**: Leverage AI tools for code generation and accurate calculation of orbital parameters for dynamic simulations.

## **Technologies Used**

- **3D Graphics**: Built using open-source 3D graphics libraries like Three.js/WebGL.
- **NASA Data Integration**: Celestial body data retrieved from NASAâ€™s Small Body Database and other public datasets.
- **Orbital Propagator**: Implemented to calculate real-time movement of celestial bodies in the dynamic orrery.
- **Web Application**: Developed as a web-based application, ensuring accessibility across multiple browsers (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- **AI Assistance**: Utilized AI to assist with orbit generation and handling data for real-time simulations.
