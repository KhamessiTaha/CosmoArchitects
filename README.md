# **Interactive Orrery Web App**            
              
## **Overview**          
This project is our submission for the **2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge**. Our aim is to create an interactive orrery web app that visualizes celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) in our solar system. The orrery offers both a static view and a dynamic, animated model that showcases the orbital paths and positions of these celestial bodies over time.
      
The web app is designed to educate users about celestial objects, with features that allow real-time exploration of planetary and asteroid data, supported by NASAâ€™s publicly available datasets.

### **Event**: 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge  
### **Categories**: Astrophysics, Space Exploration, Software, Games, Planets & Moons  
### **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate to Advanced.

## **Features**

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: View the solar system in an interactive manner with the ability to zoom, pan, and rotate.
- **Real-time Celestial Body Data**: Visualize the position of planets, NECs, NEAs, and PHAs using NASA's Keplerian parameters.
- **Orbital Trajectories**: Explore the colored orbital trajectories of celestial bodies, with options to enable/disable specific orbits.
- **Speed & Timeline Control**: Control the speed of the simulation and jump to a specific date to observe the solar system at any given time.
- **Labels and Views**: Toggle labels for celestial objects and switch between exterior and interior spaceship views.
- **AI-Powered Orbit Calculation**: Leverage AI tools for code generation and accurate calculation of orbital parameters for dynamic simulations.

## **How to Use the Web App**

1. **Navigation**: Use mouse controls or touch gestures to pan, zoom, and rotate around the solar system.
2. **Control Panel**: Utilize the control panel to switch between labels, toggle orbital paths, and control the simulation speed.
3. **Time Travel**: Move the timeline slider to observe the celestial positions at any past or future date.
4. **Explore Near-Earth Objects**: Use the object filter to focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids or comets.
5. **AI Features**: The orbit calculation in real-time is AI-generated, making predictions for future orbits based on current parameters.
