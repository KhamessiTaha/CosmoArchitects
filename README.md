# **Interactive Orrery Web App**      

Demo is Live on Netlify [Demo](https://cosmicvue.netlify.app/) .

                                        
## **Overview**                 
This project is our submission for the **2024 NASA International Space Apps Challenge**. It showcases an interactive orrery web app designed to visualize celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) including Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs),  within our solar system.

The app features a dynamic, animated model that traces the orbital paths and positions of these celestial bodies over time, utilizing real-time data. Our goal is to educate users about these objects through an intuitive, 3D visualization tool supported by NASA's public datasets.

### **Event**: 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge  
### **Categories**: Astrophysics, Space Exploration, Software, Games, Planets & Moons  
### **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate to Advanced.

## **Features**

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: View the solar system in an interactive manner with the ability to zoom, pan, and rotate.
- **NASA's Celestial Body Data**: Visualize the position of planets, NECs, NEAs, and PHAs using NASA's Keplerian parameters.
- **Orbital Trajectories**: Explore the colored orbital trajectories of celestial bodies, with options to enable/disable specific orbits.
- **Speed & Timeline Control**: Control the speed of the simulation to observe the solar system at different speeds.
- **Labels and Views**: Toggle labels for celestial objects (NEOs).

## **Technologies Used**  

- **3D Graphics**: Built using open-source 3D graphics library Three.js.
- **NASA Data Integration**: Celestial body data retrieved from NASAâ€™s Small Body Database and other public datasets/APIs.
- **Orbital Propagator**: Implemented to calculate real-time movement of celestial bodies in the dynamic orrery.
- **Web Application**: Developed as a web-based application, ensuring accessibility across multiple browsers (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices.

## **Objectives**

The main objectives for this project are:

- **Interactive Education**: Provide a visual and interactive platform for users to learn about the solar system and its celestial bodies.
- **Real-time Orbit Visualization**: Accurately represent the position of celestial objects at any given time.
- **User Engagement**: Enable users to explore and manipulate the visualization by controlling time, speed, and the point of view in the orrery.

## **How to Use the Web App**

1. **Navigation**: Use mouse controls or touch gestures to pan, zoom, and rotate around the solar system.
2. **Control Panel**: Utilize the control panel to switch between labels, toggle orbital paths, and control the simulation speed.
3. **Time Travel**: Click the 'Faster' or 'Slower' buttons to observe the celestial movements at different speeds.
4. **Explore Near-Earth Objects**: Use the object filter to focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids or comets.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Enhanced AI Orbit Predictions**: Further improve AI-generated orbits with more accurate long-term trajectory predictions.
- **Expanded Object Database**: Include more detailed data for additional celestial bodies.
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Optimize the web app for mobile devices to enhance accessibility.
